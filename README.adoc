[quote, E.W. Dijkstra, 'https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html[The Humble Programmer]']
The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague.
